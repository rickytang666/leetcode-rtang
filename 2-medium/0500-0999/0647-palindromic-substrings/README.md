## Description

Given a string `s`, return *the number of **palindromic substrings** in it*.

A string is a **palindrome** when it reads the same backward as forward.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

How can we reuse a previously computed palindrome to compute a larger palindrome?

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

If “aba” is a palindrome, is “xabax” a palindrome? Similarly is “xabay” a palindrome?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Complexity based hint:</br>
If we use brute force and check whether for every start and end position a substring is a palindrome we have O(n^2) start - end pairs and O(n) palindromic checks. Can we reduce the time for palindromic checks to O(1) by reusing some previous computation?
