# 207. Course Schedule

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Acceptance Rate:** 50.8%

**Tags:** `Depth-First Search`, `Breadth-First Search`, `Graph Theory`, `Topological Sort`

## Description

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites[i] are **unique**.

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
