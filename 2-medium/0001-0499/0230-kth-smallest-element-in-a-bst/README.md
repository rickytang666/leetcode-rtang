# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Acceptance Rate:** 76.2%

**Tags:** `Tree`, `Depth-First Search`, `Binary Search Tree`, `Binary Tree`

---

## Description

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` *smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/28/kthtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
* `1 <= k <= n <= 104`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Try to utilize the property of a BST.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Try in-order traversal. (Credits to @chan13)

<summary>Hint 3</summary>

What if you could modify the BST node's structure?
