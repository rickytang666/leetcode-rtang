# 57. Insert Interval

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Acceptance Rate:** 44.6%

**Tags:** `Array`

---

## Description

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represent the start and the end of the `ith` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `starti`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `starti` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals` *after the insertion*.

**Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= intervals.length <= 104`
* `intervals[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= starti <= endi <= 105`
* `intervals` is sorted by `starti` in **ascending** order.
* `newInterval.length == 2`
* `0 <= start <= end <= 105`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Intervals Array is sorted. Can you use Binary Search to find the correct position to insert the new Interval.?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Can you try merging the overlapping intervals while inserting the new interval?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

This can be done by comparing the end of the last interval with the start of the new interval and vice versa.
