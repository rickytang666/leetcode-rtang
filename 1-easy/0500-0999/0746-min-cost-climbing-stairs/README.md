# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Acceptance Rate:** 67.9%

**Tags:** `Array`, `Dynamic Programming`

---

## Description

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cost = [10,15,20]
Output: 15
Explanation: You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>

Build an array dp where dp[i] is the minimum cost to climb to the top starting from the ith staircase.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>

Assuming we have n staircase labeled from 0 to n - 1 and assuming the top is n, then dp[n] = 0, marking that if you are at the top, the cost is 0.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>

Now, looping from n - 1 to 0, the dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i + 1], dp[i + 2]). The answer will be the minimum of dp[0] and dp[1]
