## Description

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

Return *the **total frequencies** of elements in*`nums` *such that those elements all have the **maximum** frequency*.

The **frequency** of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## Hints

1. Find frequencies of all elements of the array.
2. Find the elements that have the maximum frequencies and count their total occurrences.
