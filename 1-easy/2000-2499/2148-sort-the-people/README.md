## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of elements that have **both** a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in* `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
Output: 2
Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

## Hints

1. All the elements in the array should be counted except for the minimum and maximum elements.
2. If the array has n elements, the answer will be n - count(min(nums)) - count(max(nums))
3. This formula will not work in case the array has all the elements equal, why?
