# 2621. Sleep

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Acceptance Rate:** 87.4%

---

## Description

Given a positive integer `millis`, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for `millis` milliseconds. It can resolve any value.

**Note** that *minor* deviation from `millis` in the actual sleep duration is acceptable.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: millis = 200
Output: 200
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= millis <= 1000`

## Hints

1. In Javascript, you can execute code after some delay with the setTimeout(fn, sleepTime) function.
2. An async function is defined as function which returns a Promise.
3. To create a Promise, you can code new Promise((resolve, reject) => {}). When you want the function to return a value, code resolve(value) inside the callback.
