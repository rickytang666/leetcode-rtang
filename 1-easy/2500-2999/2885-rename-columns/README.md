## Description

```
DataFrame students
+-------------+--------+
| Column Name | Type   |
+-------------+--------+
| id          | int    |
| first       | object |
| last        | object |
| age         | int    |
+-------------+--------+
```

Write a solution to rename the columns as follows:

* `id` to `student_id`
* `first` to `first_name`
* `last` to `last_name`
* `age` to `age_in_years`

The result format is in the following example.

```
Example 1:
Input:
+----+---------+----------+-----+
| id | first   | last     | age |
+----+---------+----------+-----+
| 1  | Mason   | King     | 6   |
| 2  | Ava     | Wright   | 7   |
| 3  | Taylor  | Hall     | 16  |
| 4  | Georgia | Thompson | 18  |
| 5  | Thomas  | Moore    | 10  |
+----+---------+----------+-----+
Output:
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
| student_id | first_name | last_name | age_in_years |
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
| 1          | Mason      | King      | 6            |
| 2          | Ava        | Wright    | 7            |
| 3          | Taylor     | Hall      | 16           |
| 4          | Georgia    | Thompson  | 18           |
| 5          | Thomas     | Moore     | 10           |
+------------+------------+-----------+--------------+
