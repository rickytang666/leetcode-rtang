# 1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Acceptance Rate:** 82.3%

**Tags:** `Linked List`, `Math`

---

## Description

Given `head` which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either `0` or `1`. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the *decimal value* of the number in the linked list.

The **most significant bit** is at the head of the linked list.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/05/graph-1.png)

```
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* The Linked List is not empty.
* Number of nodes will not exceed `30`.
* Each node's value is either `0` or `1`.

## Hints

1. Traverse the linked list and store all values in a string or array. convert the values obtained to decimal value.
2. You can solve the problem in O(1) memory using bits operation. use shift left operation ( << ) and or operation ( | ) to get the decimal value in one operation.
