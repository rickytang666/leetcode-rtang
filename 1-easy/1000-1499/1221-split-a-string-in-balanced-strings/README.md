## Description

**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it into some number of substrings such that:

* Each substring is balanced.

Return *the **maximum** number of balanced strings you can obtain.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
Output: 2
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
Note that s cannot be split into "RL", "RR", "RL", "LR", "LL", because the 2nd and 5th substrings are not balanced.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
* `s` is a **balanced** string.

## Hints

1. Loop from left to right maintaining a balance variable when it gets an L increase it by one otherwise decrease it by one.
2. Whenever the balance variable reaches zero then we increase the answer by one.
