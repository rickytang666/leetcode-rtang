# 1925. Count Square Sum Triples

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Acceptance Rate:** 77.1%

**Tags:** `Math`, `Enumeration`

## Description

A **square triple** `(a,b,c)` is a triple where `a`, `b`, and `c` are **integers** and `a2 + b2 = c2`.

Given an integer `n`, return *the number of **square triples** such that* `1 <= a, b, c <= n`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5) and (4,3,5).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: The square triples are (3,4,5), (4,3,5), (6,8,10), and (8,6,10).
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 250`

---

## Hints

1. Iterate over all possible pairs (a,b) and check that the square root of a * a + b * b is an integers less than or equal n
2. You can check that the square root of an integer is an integer using binary seach or a builtin function like sqrt
